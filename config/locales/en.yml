# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      welcome_first_li: "To help farmers to provide fruits and vegetables
                        directly to consumers. Farmers have been the catalyst
                        for getting this project started as we believe they are
                        the ones suffuring the most during the COVID-19
                        pandemic. However, fishermen and butchers can also use
                        this platform to sell their goods too! Later, we'll
                        allow any food services, florists, herbalists and others
                        to sell to consumers."

                         delivery service as it is almost nonexistent. The goal
                         is to start in Guadeloupe as this is where the team
                         members are coming from and then expand it to all the
